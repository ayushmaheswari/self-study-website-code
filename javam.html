<h2>What is Java?</h2>
<p>
Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, </br>
class-based, object-oriented,and specifically designed to have as few </br>
implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application </br>
developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code </br>
can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</br>

<h3>Uses of Java</h3>
Java was designed to have the look and feel of the C++ language, but it </br>
is simpler to use than C++ and enforces an object-oriented programming model.</br> 
Java can be used to create complete applications that may run on a single </br>
computer or be distributed among servers and clients in a network.</br>

<h3>Object & Class</h3>
<h4>Object:</h4>
An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g. chair, </br>
bike, marker, pen, table, car etc.</br>
It can be physical or logical .</br>

<h3>Class:</h3>
A class is a group of objects which have common properties.</br>
It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. </br>
It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.</br>
 
<h3>Constructor</h3>
 It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.</br>
 
 <h3>Inheritance</h3>
 Inheritance in java is a mechanism in which one object 
 acquires all the properties and behaviors of parent object.</br>
 
 <h3>Method Overloading</h3>
 If a class has multiple methods having same name but </br>
 different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.</br>
 
 <h3>Method Overriding</h3>
 If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in </br>
 the parent class, it is known as method overriding in java.<br>
 
 <h3>Super Keyword</h3>
 The super keyword in java is a reference variable </br>
 which is used to refer immediate parent class object.</br>
 
 <h3>Runtime Polymorphism</h3>
 Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch is a process in which a </br>
 call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.</br>
 
 <h3>Abstraction Class</h3>
 A class that is declared with abstract keyword, is known as abstract </br>
 class in java.It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with body).</br>
 
 <h3>Java String</h3>
 Java String class provides a lot of methods to perform operations on string such as compare(),</br> 
 concat(), equals(), split(), length(), replace(), compareTo(), intern(), substring() etc.</br>
 
 <h3>Java Multithreading</h3>
 Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.</br>
 
 <h3>Java Regex</h3>
 The Java Regex or Regular Expression is an API to define pattern for <br>
 searching or manipulating strings.<br>
 
 <h3>Java I/O</h3>
 Java I/O (Input and Output) is used to process the input and produce the output.</br>
 
 <h3>Java Inner Class</h3>
 Java inner class or nested class is a class which is declared inside the class or interface.</br>
 
 <h3>Java Networking</h3>
 Java Networking is a concept of connecting two or more computing devices </br>
 together so that we can share resources.Java socket programming provides </br>
 facility to share data between different computing devices.</br>

 <h3>Java AWT</h3>
Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) is an API to develop GUI or window-based </br>
applications in java.Java AWT components are platform-dependent i.e. components </br>
are displayed according to the view of operating system. AWT is heavyweight </br>
i.e. its components are using the resources of OS.The java.awt package provides </br>
classes for AWT api such as TextField, Label, TextArea, RadioButton, CheckBox, Choice, List etc.</br>

<h3>Java Conversion</h3>
We can convert String to int in java using Integer.parseInt() method.</br> 
To convert String into Integer,we can use Integer.</br>
valueOf() method which returns instance of Integer class.</br>
 
<h3>Java Applet</h3>
 Applet is a special type of program that is embedded in the webpage to </br>
 generate the dynamic content.It runs inside the browser and works at client side.</br>
 
<h3>Java Swing</h3>
 Java Swing tutorial is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that </br>
 is used to create window-based applications.It is built on the top of </br>
 AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) API and entirely written in java.</br>
