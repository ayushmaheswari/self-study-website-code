<h1> What is C? </h1>
C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by </br>
Dennis M.Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was </br>
originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.</br>

<h3>C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons −</h3>
* Easy to learn</br>
* Structured language</br>
* It produces efficient programs</br>
* It can handle low-level activities</br>
* It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms</br>

<h3>Facts about C</h3>
* C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.</br>
* C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.</br>
* The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).</br>
* The UNIX OS was totally written in C.</br>
* Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.</br>
* Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.</br>
* Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.</br>

<h3>Why use C?</h3>
C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up</br>
the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces </br>
code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. </br></br>
Some examples of the use of C might be −</br>

* Operating Systems</br>
* Language Compilers</br>
* Assemblers</br>
* Text Editors</br>
* Print Spoolers</br>
* Network Drivers</br>
* Modern Programs</br>
* Databases</br>
* Language Interpreters</br>
* Utilities</br>

<h2>Structure of c programe</h2>
A C program basically consists of the following parts −</br>

* Preprocessor Commands</br>
* Functions</br>
* Variables</br>
* Statements & Expressions</br>
* Comments</br></br>
Example--</br></br>

#include <stdio.h></br>
int main() </br>
{</br>
   /* my first program in C */</br>
   printf("Hello, World! \n");</br>
   return 0;</br>
}</br>

<h2>Storage Classes</h3>
A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C Program. </br>
They precede the type that they modify. We have four different storage classes in a C program −</br>
<h4>The auto Storage Class</h4>
The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.</br></br>
{</br>
   int mount;</br>
   auto int month;</br>
}</br>

<h4>The register Storage Class</h4>
The register storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM.</br>
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters.</br></br>
{</br>
   register int  miles;</br>
}</br>

<h4>The static Storage Class</h4>
The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during </br>
the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope.</br>
The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, </br>
it causes that variable's scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.</br>

<h4>The extern Storage Class</h4>
The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is </br>
visible to ALL the program files. When you use 'extern', the variable cannot be initialized</br> 
however, it points the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.</br></br>
#include <stdio.h></br>
 int count ;</br>
extern void write_extern();</br>
main() {</br>
   count = 5;</br>
   write_extern();</br>
}</br>

<h2>LOOP TYPES</h2>
	There may be a situation, when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.</br> 
	In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.</br>
    Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</br>
    A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general from of a loop statement</br> 
	in most of the programming languages −C++ programming language provides the following type of loops to handle looping requirements.</br>
	
	<h4>While loop</h4>
    Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.</br></br>
    while(condition)</br> 
	{statement(s);}</br>
	
	<h4>for loop</h4>
    Execute a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.</br></br>
    for ( init; condition; increment )</br> 
	{statement(s);}</br>
	
	<h4>do...while loop</h4>
    Like a ‘while’ statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.</br></br>
    do </br>
	{statement(s);}</br> 
    while( condition );</br>
	
	<h4>nested loops</h4>
    You can use one or more loop inside any another ‘while’, ‘for’ or ‘do..while’ loop.</br></br>
	
	The syntax for a nested for loop statement in C++ is as follows −</br>
    for ( init; condition; increment ) {</br>
    for ( init; condition; increment ) {</br>
    statement(s);</br>
    }</br>
    statement(s);</br>
    }</br></br>

	The syntax for a nested while loop statement in C++ is as follows −</br>

    while(condition) {</br>
    while(condition) {</br>
    statement(s);</br>
    }</br>
    statement(s); // you can put more statements.}</br></br>
    The syntax for a nested do...while loop statement in C++ is as follows −</br>
    do </br>
	{statement(s);</br>
    do </br>
	{  statement(s);} </br>
	while( condition );</br>
    } while( condition );<br></br>
	
	<h3>LOOP CONTROL STATEMENT</h3>
	break statement</br>
    Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.</br></br>

	continue statement</br>
    Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.</br></br>

	goto statement</br>
    Transfers control to the labeled statement. Though it is not advised to use goto statement in your program.</br></br>
	
	<h3>THE INFINITY LOOP</h3>
	A loop becomes infinite loop if a condition never becomes false.</br>
	The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. </br>
	Since none of the three expressions that form the ‘for’ loop are required,</br> 
	you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.</br></br>
	
	#include <iostream></br>
    using namespace std;</br>
    int main () {</br>
    for( ; ; ) {</br>
    printf("This loop will run forever.\n");}</br> 
	return 0;}</br>
	
	<h3>UNION</h3>
	A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data </br>
	types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but </br>
	only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way</br> 
	of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.</br></br>
	union Data {</br>
   int i;</br>
   float f;</br>
   char str[20];</br>
   } data;</br>
