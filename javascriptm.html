<h1> What is JavaScript? </h1>
JavaScript is an object-based scripting language that is lightweight and cross-platform.</br>
JavaScript is not compiled but translated. The JavaScript Translator </br>
(embedded in browser) is responsible to translate the JavaScript code.</br>

<h4>Where JavaScript is used</h4>
JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:</br></br>

* Client-side validation</br>
* Dynamic drop-down menus</br>
* Displaying data and time</br>
* Displaying popup windows and dialog boxes (like alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box)</br>
* Displaying clocks etc.</br>

<h4>JavaScript Example</h4>
Welcome to JavaScript </br>
(script)  </br>
document.write("Hello JavaScript by JavaScript"); </br> 
(/script)  </br>

<h2>JavaScript Comment</h2>
The JavaScript comments are meaningful way to deliver message. It is used to add information </br>
about the code, warnings or suggestions so that end user can easily interpret the code.</br>
The JavaScript comment is ignored by the JavaScript engine i.e. embedded in the browser.</br>

<h3>Advantages of JavaScript comments</h3>
<h5>There are mainly two advantages of JavaScript comments.</h5>

* To make code easy to understand It can be used to elaborate the code so that end user can easily understand the code.</br>
* To avoid the unnecessary code It can also be used to avoid the code being executed. </br>
Sometimes, we add the code to perform some action. But after sometime, </br>
there may be need to disable the code. In such case, it is better to use comments.</br>

<h3>Types of JavaScript Comments</h3>

<h5>There are two types of comments in JavaScript.</h5>
1. Single-line Comment</br>
It is represented by double forward slashes (//). It can be used before and after the statement.</br>
Letâ€™s see the example of single-line comment i.e. added before the statement</br></br>

2. Multi-line Comment</br>
It can be used to add single as well as multi line comments. So, it is more convenient.</br>
It is represented by forward slash with asterisk then asterisk with forward slash.</br></br>

<h4>If statement</h4>
It evaluates the content only if expression is true. The signature of JavaScript if statement is given below.</br>

if(expression){  </br>
//content to be evaluated</br>  
}  </br>

<h4>If...else Statement</h4>
It evaluates the content whether condition is true of false. </br>
The syntax of JavaScript if-else statement is given below.</br>

if(expression){  </br>
//content to be evaluated if condition is true  </br>
}  </br>
else{  </br>
//content to be evaluated if condition is false</br>  
}  </br>

<h4>Switch</h4>
The JavaScript switch statement is used to execute one code from multiple expressions.</br> 
It is just like else if statement that we have learned in previous page. But it is </br>
convenient than if..else..if because it can be used with numbers, characters etc.</br>
The signature of JavaScript switch statement is given below.</br></br>

switch(expression){  </br>
case value1:  </br>
 code to be executed;</br>  
 break;  </br>
case value2:  </br>
 code to be executed;</br>  
 break;  </br>
......  </br>
 default:   </br>
 code to be executed if above values are not matched;</br>  
}  </br>

<h3>Browser Object Model</h3>
Browser Object Model (BOM)</br>
The Browser Object Model (BOM) is used to interact with the browser.</br>

The default object of browser is window means you can call all the functions of window by specifying window or directly.</br>
 For example:</br>
window.alert("hello javatpoint");</br>

<h3>Form Validation</h3>
It is important to validate the form submitted by the user because it can have inappropriate values. </br>
So validation is must.The JavaScript provides you the facility the validate the form on the client </br>
side so processing will be fast than server-side validation. So, most of the web developers prefer JavaScript form validation.</br>
<h5>form validation example</h5>
 
form name="myform" method="post" action="abc.jsp" onsubmit="return validateform()" </br>  
Name: input type="text" name="name"<br/>  
Password: input type="password" name="password"<br/>  
input type="submit" value="register"</br>
/form  </br>

<h5>Events    :    	   Description</h5>
   onclick    : occurs when element is clicked.</br>
   ondblclick : occurs when element is double-clicked.</br>
   onfocus    : occurs when an element gets focus such as button, input, textarea etc.</br>
   onblur     : occurs when form looses the focus from an element.</br>
   onsubmit	  : occurs when form is submitted.</br>
   onmouseover:	occurs when mouse is moved over an element.</br>
   onmouseout : occurs when mouse is moved out from an element (after moved over).</br>
   onmousedown:	occurs when mouse button is pressed over an element.</br>
   onmouseup  :	occurs when mouse is released from an element (after mouse is pressed).</br>
   onload	  : occurs when document, object or frameset is loaded.</br>
   onunload	  : occurs when body or frameset is unloaded.</br>
   onscroll	  : occurs when document is scrolled.</br>
   onresized  :	occurs when document is resized.</br>
