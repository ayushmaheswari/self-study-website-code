<h1> What is python? </h1>
Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high level and interpreted programming language. </br>
It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple </br>
and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.Python is easy to learn </br>
yet powerful and versatile scripting language which makes it attractive for Application Development.</br>
Python's syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature, makes it an ideal language </br>
for scripting and rapid application development.Python supports multiple programming pattern, </br>
including object oriented, imperative and functional or procedural programming styles.</br>

<h2>Control statement</h2>
<h3>If Statements</h3>
The Python if statement is a statement which is used to test specified condition. </br>
We can use if statement to perform conditional operations in our Python application.</br>
The if statement executes only when specified condition is true. We can pass any valid </br>
expression into the if parentheses.There are various types of if statements in Python.</br></br>
Python If Statement Syntax</br></br>
if(condition): </br> 
   statements  </br>
   
<h3>If Else Statements</h3>
The If statement is used to test specified condition and if the condition is true, if block</br> 
executes, otherwise else block executes.The else statement executes when the if statement is false.</br></br>

Python If Else Syntax:</br></br>

if(condition):  False  </br>
             statements  </br>
    else:   True  </br>
              statements</br>  

<h3>Nested If Else Statement</h3>
In python, we can use nested If Else to check multiple conditions. Python provides elif keyword to </br>
make nested If statement.This statement is like executing a if statement inside a else statement.</br></br>

Python Nested If Else Syntax</br></br>

If statement:  </br>
    Body  </br>
elif statement:</br>  
    Body  </br>
else:  </br>
    Body    </br>
	
<h3>For Loop</h3>
Python for loop is used to iterate the elements of a collection in the order that they appear.</br> 
This collection can be a sequence(list or string).</br></br>

Python For Loop Syntax</br></br>

for (variable) in (sequence): </br> 

<h3>Nested For Loops</h3>
Loops defined within another Loop are called Nested Loops. Nested loops are used to iterate matrix elements or to </br>
perform complex computation.When an outer loop contains an inner loop in its body it is called Nested Looping.</br>

Python Nested For Loop Syntax:</br></br>
for  expression:  </br>
        for expression:</br>  
            Body  			  </br>
			
<h3>While Loop</h3>
In Python, while loop is used to execute number of statements or body till the specified </br>
condition is true. Once the condition is false, the control will come out of the loop.</br>
Python While Loop Syntax</br></br>
while expression:  </br>
        Body  </br>
	
<h2>OOPS Concepts</h2>
Python is an object-oriented programming language. It allows us to develop applications </br>
using Object Oriented approach. In Python, we can easily create and use classes and objects.</br></br>

Major principles of object-oriented programming system are given below</br></br>

* Object</br>
* Class</br>
* Method</br>
* Inheritance</br>
* Polymorphism</br>
* Data Abstraction</br>
* Encapsulation</br>

<h3>Object</h3>
Object is an entity that has state and behavior. It may be anything.</br> 
It may be physical and logical. For example: mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen etc.</br>
Everything in Python is an object, and almost everything has attributes and methods. All functions </br>
have a built-in attribute __doc__, which returns the doc string defined in the function source code.</br>

<h3>Class</h3>
Class can be defined as a collection of objects. It is a logical entity that has some specific attributes and methods.</br> 
For example: if you have an employee class then it should contain an attribute and method i.e. an email id, name, age, salary etc.</br></br>
Syntax:</br></br>
class ClassName:</br>  
    (statement-1)  </br>
    .  </br>
    .  </br>
    .  </br>
    (statement-N)</br>  

<h3>Method</h3>
Method is a function that is associated with an object. In Python, </br>
method is not unique to class instances. Any object type can have methods.</br>

<h3>Inheritance</h3>
Inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming. It specifies that one object </br>
acquires all the properties and behaviors of parent object. By using inheritance you can </br>
define a new class with a little or no changes to the existing class. The new class is known as</br> 
derived class or child class and from which it inherits the properties is called base class or parent class.</br>
It provides re-usability of the code.</br>

<h3>Polymorphism</h3>
Polymorphism is made by two words "poly" and "morphs". Poly means many and Morphs means form, shape. </br>
It defines that one task can be performed in different ways. For example: You have a class animal and </br>
all animals talk. But they talk differently. Here, the "talk" behavior is polymorphic in the sense and </br>
totally depends on the animal. So, the abstract "animal" concept does not actually "talk", but specific </br>
animals (like dogs and cats) have a concrete implementation of the action "talk".</br>

<h3>Encapsulation</h3>
Encapsulation is also the feature of object-oriented programming. </br>
It is used to restrict access to methods and variables. In encapsulation,</br> 
code and data are wrapped together within a single unit from being modified by accident.</br>

<h3>Data Abstraction</h3>
Data abstraction and encapsulation both are often used as synonyms. </br>
Both are nearly synonym because data abstraction is achieved through encapsulation.</br>
Abstraction is used to hide internal details and show only functionalities. Abstracting something </br>
means to give names to things, so that the name captures the core of what a function or a whole program does.</br>

<h2>Python Constructors</h2>
A constructor is a special type of method (function) which is used to initialize the </br>
instance members of the class. Constructor can be parameterized and non-parameterized as well.</br> 
Constructor definition executes when we create object of the class. Constructors also verify </br>
that there are enough resources for the object to perform any start-up task.</br>

<h3>Creating a Constructor</h3>

A constructor is a class function that begins with double underscore (_). </br>
The name of the constructor is always the same __init__().</br>
While creating an object, a constructor can accept arguments if necessary.</br> 
When we create a class without a constructor, Python automatically creates </br>
a default constructor that doesn't do anything.Every class must have a constructor,</br> 
even if it simply relies on the default constructor.</br>

<h4>Non Parameterized Constructor Example</h4>
class Student:  </br>
    # Constructor - non parameterized</br>  
    def __init__(self):  </br>
        print("This is non parametrized constructor")</br>  
    def show(self,name):  </br>
        print("Hello",name)  </br>
student = Student()  </br>
student.show("irfan")  </br>

<h4>Parameterized Constructor Example</h4>
class Student:  </br>
    # Constructor - parameterized </br> 
    def __init__(self, name):  </br>
        print("This is parametrized constructor")</br>  
        self.name = name  </br>
    def show(self):  </br>
        print("Hello",self.name)</br>  
student = Student("irfan")  </br>
student.show()  </br>
