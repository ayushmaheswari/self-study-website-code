<h2>What is Ruby</h2>
<p>Ruby is a dynamic, open source, object oriented and reflective programming language. </br>
Ruby is considered similar to Perl and Smalltalk programming languages. </br>
It runs on all types of platforms like Windows, Mac OS and all versions of UNIX. </br>
It is fully object oriented programming language. Everything is an object in Ruby. </br>
Each and every code has their properties and actions.  </br>
Here properties refer to variables and actions refer to methods. </br>

<h3>Ruby data types</h3>
Data types represents a type of data such as text, string, numbers, etc.  </br>
There are different data types in Ruby: </br>
* Numbers </br>
* Strings </br>
* Symbols </br>
* Hashes </br>
* Arrays </br>
* Booleans </br>

<h3>Ruby Object Class</h3>
<h4> Object</h4>
object is the default root of all Ruby objects.Ruby objects inherit from  </br>
BasicObject (it is the parent class of all classes in Ruby) which allows  </br>
creating alternate object hierarchies.Object mixes in the Kernel module  </br>
which makes the built-in Kernel functions globally accessible. </br>
<h4> Class </h4>
Each Ruby class is an instance of class Class. Classes in Ruby are first-class objects. </br>
Ruby class always starts with the keyword class followed by the class name. Conventionally,  </br>
for class name we use CamelCase. The class name should always start with a capital letter.  </br>
Defining class is finished with end keyword. </br>

<h3>Ruby Methods</h3>
Ruby methods prevent us from writing the same code in a program again and again.  </br>
It is a set of expression that returns a value. </br>
Ruby methods are similar to the functions in other lnguages. </br> 
They unite one or more repeatable statements into one single bundle. </br>

<h3>Ruby Blocks</h3>
Ruby code blocks are called closures in other programming languages. </br>
It consist of a group of codes which is always enclosed with braces  </br>
or written between do..end.The braces syntax always have the higher  </br>
precedence over the do..end syntax Braces have high precedence and do has low precedence. </br>
 
<h3>Ruby Modules</h3>
Ruby module is a collection of methods and constants. A module method  </br>
may be instance method or module method.Instance methods are methods in a  </br>
class when module is included.Module methods may be called without creating  </br>
an encapsulating object while instance methods may not.They are similar to  </br>
classes as they hold a collection of methods, class definitions, constants  </br>
and other modules. They are defined like classes.Objects or subclasses can  </br>
not be created using modules. There is no module hierarchy of inheritance. </br>

<h3>Ruby Strings</h3>
Ruby string object holds and manipulates an arbitary sequence of bytes,  </br>
typically representing characters. They are created using String::new or as literals. </br>
 
<h3>Ruby Arrays</h3>
Ruby arrays are ordered collections of objects. They can hold objects  </br>
like integer, number, hash, string, symbol or any other array.Its indexing  </br>
starts with 0. The negative index starts with -1 from the end of the array. </br>
For example, -1 indicates last element of the array and 0 indicates first element of the array. </br>

<h3>RUBY Hashes</h3>
A Ruby hash is a collection of unique keys and their values. They are similar  </br>
to arrays but array use integer as an index and hash use any object type. </br>
They are also called associative arrays, dictionaries or maps. </br>
If a hash is accessed with a key that does not exist, the method will return nil. </br>

<h3>RUBY Ranges</h3>
Ruby range represents a set of values with a beginning and an end.  </br>
They can be constructed using s..e and s...e literals or with ::new. </br>
The ranges which has .. in them, run from beginning to end inclusively. </br>
The ranges which has ... in them, run exclusively the end value. </br>

<h3>RUBY Iterators</h3>
Iterator is a concept used in object-oriented language.  </br>
Iteration means doing one thing many times like a loop. </br>
The loop method is the simplest iterator.  </br>
They return all the elements from a collection, one after the other. </br>
arrays and hashes come in the category of collection. </br>

<h3>RUBY File I/O</h3>
Ruby I/O is a way to interact with your system. Data is sent in the form of bytes/characters.  </br>
IO class is the basis for all input and output in Ruby. It may be duplexed,  </br>
hence may use more than one native operating system stream.IO has a subclass  </br>
as File class which allows reading and writing files in Ruby. The two classes are  </br>
closely associated. IO object represent readable/writable interactions to keyboards and screens. </br>

<h3>RUBY Directories</h3>
Class Dir has directory streams as objects which represents directories  </br>
in underlying file system.Directories are handled with Dir class. </br>
<h3>RUBY Exceptions</h3>
Ruby exception is an object, an instance of the class Exception or descendent  </br>
of that class.It represents some exceptional condition. </br>
In a Ruby program, when something goes wrong, it throws an exceptional behavior. </br> 
By default Ruby program terminates on throwing an exception. </br>
We can declare some exception handlers within Ruby. An exception handler is  </br>
a block of code which is executed when exception occurs in some other block of code. </br>

<h3>RUBY OOPs</h3>
Ruby is a true object oriented language which can be embedded into  </br>
Hypertext Markup Language.Everything in Ruby is an object.  </br>
All the numbers, strings or even class is an object. </br>
The whole Ruby language is basically built on the concepts of object and data. </br>
OOPs is a programming concept that uses objects and their interactions  </br>
to design applications and computer programs. </br>

<h3>RUBY Multithreading</h3>
A normal program has single thread of execution. </br>
 All the statements in the program are executed sequentially. </br>
A multi thread program has more than one thread of execution in it. </br>
 It uses less memory space and share same address space. </br>
 Multithreading is used to perform more than one task at once. </br>
A new thread is created using thread.new call. </br>
It is different from the main thread's execution. </br>
